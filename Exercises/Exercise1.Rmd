```{r}
#Read the cars data

cars <-read.csv("../data-visualization-Andrew Heiss/data/cars.csv", header = T)

#Check the variables included (numerical, and text variables)

str(cars)

```

```{r}
# My first plots
#Insert a chunk below and use it to create a scatterplot (hint: `geom_point()`) with diplacement (`displ`) on the x-axis, city MPG (`cty`) on #the y-axis, and with the points colored by drive (`drv`).

ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = displ, y = cty)) + geom_point( alpha = 0.1, aes(color = drv)) # Scatter Plot
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = hwy)) + geom_histogram()

```

```{r}
# My first data manipulation
#Insert a chunk below and use it to calculate the average city MPG (`cty`) by class of car (`class`). This won't be a plot---it'll be a table. Hint: use a combination of #`group_by()` and `summarize()`.

cars %>% group_by(class) %>% 
  summarize(cty)

```
